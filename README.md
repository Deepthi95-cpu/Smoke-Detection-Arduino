# 🔥 Smoke Detection System using Arduino

An Arduino-based smoke detection system that alerts users when smoke levels exceed a safe threshold. This project simulates a basic fire alarm using a gas sensor, LEDs, and a buzzer — all built and tested on Tinkercad.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Detects smoke using an MQ-2 gas sensor
- 🟢 Green LED = Safe
- 🔴 Red LED + Buzzer = Smoke detected
- 🧠 Built using Arduino Uno R3
- 💻 Simulated online (no physical hardware needed!)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Arduino Uno R3
- MQ-2 Gas Sensor
- Buzzer + LEDs
- Tinkercad (for simulation)
- C++ (Arduino code)

---

## 🔗 Live Simulation

You can try out the smoke detection circuit directly on Tinkercad:

## 🧠 How It Works
- MQ-2 sensor reads smoke/gas levels
- If value > 50:
  - Red LED turns ON
  - Buzzer beeps
- If value ≤ 50:
  - Green LED turns ON
  - Everything else stays OFF
